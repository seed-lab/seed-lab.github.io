									<h4>The explosion of data due to proliferation of energy-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) requires rethinking of computing. Data analytics applications such as deep learning, pattern recognition, mining has evolved as viable directions to convert raw data into actionable insights whereas post-CMOS technologies have shown promise to provide the desired scalability and create new frontiers in novel energy-efficient computing. With potential impact of IoT in all aspects of our day-to-day life ensuring their security and privacy from emerging attack vectors at minuscule energy/area budget is a challenge in itself. My research interest lies at the intersection of circuit, micro-architecture and hardware security using CMOS and post-CMOS nano-technologies catering to these rapidly evolving needs of computing. I have three tightly connected research efforts to achieve energy-efficiency while preserving the security and trust of IoT in Cyber Physical Systems.</h4>
									
									<h4> <strong> Data Security and Privacy of NVM [Funding: NSF] </strong> </h4>
										<h4> Summary: NVM technologies such as Spin-Transfer Torque RAM (STTRAM), Ferroelectric RAM (FeRAM), Resistive RAM (ReRAM), Phase Change RAM (PCRAM) and Domain Wall Memory (DWM) have brought lot of excitement in the design community due to leakage elimination, high density, non-volatility, low-power and high-speed. Significant research effort has been devoted to understand the viability of integrating NVMs across the memory hierarchy including Last Level Cache (LLC) and main memory. However, NVM LLC brings new security challenges that were absent in their conventional volatile memory counterparts. The root cause is persistent data and the fundamental dependency of the NVM on ambient parameters such as magnetic field and temperature that can be exploited for low-cost tampering. There are two aspects to NVM security:</h4>

										<h4> (a) Data integrity – It pertains to data corruption by malicious attack with the intention to launch denial-of-service. For example, the fixed layer of STTRAM is robust however, the free layer could be toggled through both spin polarized current as well as magnetic field. It has been shown that the STTRAM free layer could flip its polarity by a common horseshoe magnet! The same effect could also be obtained through temperature modulation and localized laser heating. Protecting data integrity against malicious attacks through ambient effect is particularly critical on deployed systems such as IoT that are hard to maintain and enforce physical security. </h4>

										<h4> (b) Data privacy –It pertains to sensitive data being compromised. Storage such as Hard Disk Drive (HDD) has traditionally been the non-volatile part of memory system that is secured by data encryption. As non-volatility is introduced at higher levels of memory stacks that traditionally were volatile more data become vulnerable that were traditionally safe. The primary challenge associated with addressing data privacy in higher levels of memory stack is performance. Closer the memory level is to CPU, the more sensitive it is to latency. Consequently, the latency associated with encryption that is used for storage is not trivial in LLC. New measures are required to guarantee security at higher levels of memory hierarchy for NVM. Considering the cost and weight of solutions such as magnetic or heat shield, it may not be practical or effective for a range of applications including many IoT devices.</h4>

									<h4> <strong> Novel and Neuro-Inspired Energy-Efficient Computing [Funding: SRC/Intel, NSF] </strong> </h4>
										<h4> Summary: The NVM technologies possess interesting features such as non-volatility, shift-based access (such as DWM) and small footprint that can be exploited at circuit/system level for energy-efficient Digital Signal Processing (DSP), deep learning, mining and recognition. The capability of the NVMs to transform one type of energy to another presents an opportunity of energy harvesting as well. Although promising, deeper inspection [TNANO15] [DATE15] reveals that NVMs suffer from several common challenges such as long write latency, high write power, scalability, susceptibility to process variations and poor sense margin. Circuit and system level techniques are required to hide/exploit these challenges. The key to NVMs scalability is dominated by the selector device. Conventional three terminal transistor selectors pose barrier to scaling whereas diode selectors increase voltage headroom (undesirable for IoT). A suitable selector device can enable large scale integration of 3D stacked memory to solve the storage challenges in data analytics.</h4>

									<h4> <strong> Security and Integrity of Hardware Systems [Funding: DARPA YFA]</strong> </h4>
										<h4> Summary: Reverse engineering (RE) of Intellectual Property (IP) for cloning and possible malicious tampering/Trojan insertion are major cause of concern for commercial and defense vendors. The state-of-the-art employs camouflaging of gates that leaves traces at the layout level or increase process cost. For IP protection there is a need to investigate alternate design paradigms that are inherently RE-resilient at conventional power, performance and robustness limits. While the field of hardware security predominantly focuses on the security and trustworthiness of IC, security analysis and protection mechanisms at higher level of hardware abstraction such as Printed Circuit Board (PCB) are scarce. With rapid proliferation of embedded systems in the emerging IoT regime, security and trust issues at system hardware level are poised to cause major security concerns and create new frontiers in hardware and supply chain security research. To achieve a high level of assurance and trust in system hardware, there is a critical need to greatly enhance our understanding of emerging vulnerabilities and explore innovative low-cost countermeasures. </h4>
